        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine chilis and fish sauce. Set aside while you prep the rest of your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add chicken and cook, tossing occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside on a plate to keep warm. Drain skillet, if needed.</li>
            <li>Return skillet over medium-high heat and heat remaining tablespoon oil. Add carrots and cook until softened, 3 minutes. Add garlic, green onions, and ginger and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add rice, 3 tablespoons of the fish sauce mixture, and oyster sauce. Toss until rice is well coated, then push rice to one side of pan.</li>
            <li>On the empty side of the pan, add a little more oil if your pan is dry. Add beaten eggs and scramble with a rubber spatula until just barely set, then combine with rice. Return chicken to skillet and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Serve with cilantro, lime wedges, and any remaining fish sauce.</li>
        </ol>
